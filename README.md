Ionic: Camera Integration
=====================

This was a POC for camera integration using Ionic

## Installation

While we recommend using the `ionic` utility to create new Ionic projects, you can use this repo as a barebones starting point to your next Ionic app.

To use this project as is, first clone the repo from GitHub, then run:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g cordova ionic gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp init
```
